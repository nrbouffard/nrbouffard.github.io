I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. As a member of the [Complex Memory Lab](https://sites.wustl.edu/complexmemlab/) and [Dynamic Cognition Lab](https://dcl.wustl.edu/) the goal of my research is to understand the behavioral and neural mechanisms that underlie
event memory in the context of aging.  

Outside of work I spends my time doing yoga, playing volleyball, cooking elaborate meals, and exploring new bars and restaurants in St. Louis!

Hippocampal autocorrelation
------
The main focus of my work is developing a novel fMRI analytic technique that measures the neural timescales of individual voxels and using this method to study gradients of neural activity in the brain, particularly the hippocampus. I aim to link the neural gradients I observe with specific aspects of event cognition and event memory.

Effects of boundaries on event memory
------
In a related line of work, I employ a sophisticated behavioral design to examine how events are processed and remembered differently in older vs. younger adults when there is partial or missing information.
